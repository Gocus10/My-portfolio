                I love climbing / gaming / and coding, basically anything to do with problem solving. I grew up in Houston, worked as a mechanic, and eventually made my way to Austin. I worked for the City of Austin on some awesome projects, like the Waller Creek Tunnel. I decided that I wanted to become a web developer to further my ability to create and help others to do the same. I put myself through the Coding bootcamp offered at UT and felt I had made the right decision for my future.

                Below is some of the work I have accomplished during my time at the coding bootcamp. I loved working with fellow classmates on big projects such as Music-line and Movie Search. I was proud of what we could accomplish in a 2-week window, as well as our ability to collaborate. I also enjoyed the solo projects I've built such as The Tech Blog as I felt as if it really cemented my understanding of the entire stack.
